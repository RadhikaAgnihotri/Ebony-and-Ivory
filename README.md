# Ebony-and-Ivory
I see myself as just one among the 8 billion paint brushes, each striving to leave their mark on the canvas of life.

The title 'Ebony and Ivory' symbolizes the concept that, akin to the dynamic interplay of white and black representing the brightest and darkest shades, every color possesses its distinct significance. As this artwork evolves, my ambition is to seamlessly fuse a myriad of elements – encompassing colors, styles, techniques, and mediums – in a continuous journey of progress and exploration.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to The Supreme Godhead. Additionally, my appreciation goes out to the countless artists across social media whose creativity has been a wellspring of motivation for my own artistic journey. I also want to express my deepest thanks to my family and friends.

As I embark on this creative endeavor, I remain open to the diverse influences that surround me. The 'Ebony and Ivory' series is not just a collection of artworks but a reflection of the kaleidoscope of life's experiences. I look forward to the continuous exploration of colors, styles, and techniques, with each stroke contributing to the unique narrative of this evolving artistic expression.
